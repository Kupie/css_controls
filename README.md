# CSS Controls

An update to blujay's [mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/489263) for CSS Controls

- Press "Y" on a tag to open up a controls editing menu. On this menu you will see:
    - "Shortcuts" - This contains stackable, common changes to control schemes (such as turning off tap jump, turning off rumble, setting tilt stick, etc.)
    - "GameCube", "Pro Controller", "Joy-Cons" - Allows editing control mappings for each controller kind individually
 
No editing tag with X unfortunately
